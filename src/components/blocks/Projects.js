				A website redesign project for a local security company with the purpose of building a faster and smoother user
				experience than their current solution that could also be decoupled from their hosting service.
				<br /><br />
				The initial site had a speed index of up to 10.6s at worst, according to lightbox.

				My redesign dramatically improved the fluidity and speed of the site. I accomplished this by building it as a
				Single-Page Application with React, and utilising more advanced features such as lazy-loading to improve the
				initial load time.
				<br /><br />
				Along with other improvements like converting all images to the Webp format the resulting design had a reported
				speed index of under 1 second.

				Lobsang Bot is an application built in Javascript utilising the Discord API to provide moderation capabilities
				via text-line to Discord servers.
				<br />
				This project was developed as an exploration of text interfaces in javascript and provided a practice ground to
				utilise ES6 features and module exports in creating a highly scalable project.
				<br /><br />
				Exporting commands/functions as an object that contained meta data about the function was one of my favourite
				structural elements of this project and a great learning experience in moving data around in Javascript. How well
				the functions are related to the user and maintainer is something I consider a success of the project and was a
				good precursor to developing my skills in React.

				<br /><br />
				If I were to revisit this project, I would take what I've learned from React in compartmentalising file systems
				and focus on building a better overall file structure for the project as I feel that, along with function bloat
				in certain places, are the core areas to learn from with this project.

				Base UI is from Academind's React - The Complete Guide course, I have extended the functionality to include a
