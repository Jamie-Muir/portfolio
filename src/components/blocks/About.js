			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Computer Science graduate investing in beginning a career working with React, Next.js, & Python.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'm a self-starter with a record of managing my own workflow and effectively managing my time and department toward success. In the past, I've been responsible for managing all the stage equipment of the largest nightclub in Aberdeen, and I've assisted in managing the General Merchandise department at Asda bridge of Dee with an excellent stock take credit result under my belt.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'm currently furthering my expertise with React and adding to my portfolio freelance jobs along with practice projects.
				<br />
				<br />
				In the future, I hope to secure a Software Development role as a front-end or full-stack developer where I can build further skills in modern languages & libraries with experienced developers and share what I've learned from my studies in React.
